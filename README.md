# Quran Kol Youm

"The best of you are those who learn the Quran and teach it." - Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) [Narrated by Al-Bukhari]

A Python-based automation tool that automatically posts pages of the Holy Quran to a Facebook Page. It posts pages sequentially from 1 to 606 (completing a Khatma), along with a beneficial supplication (Duaa).

**Live Demo:** [See the bot's page on facebook here ](https://www.facebook.com/qurankolyoum43)

## Purpose
This project serves as a **Sadaqah Jariyah**. It automates the daily posting of Quran pages to remind people to read the Quran and share religious content on social media.

## Features
- **Sequential Posting:** Page 1 → Page 606.
- **Auto-Reset:** Restarts from Page 1 automatically after finishing the Quran.
- **Smart Captions:** Random beneficial Duaa from `duaa.json`.
- **Zero Maintenance:** Runs entirely on the cloud (GitHub Actions).
